                <h3>Future of Technology</h3><br />
            
                <p>1. <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong><br>
                AI is one of the most exciting advancements in modern technology, making significant progress in areas like voice recognition, image identification, and natural language processing (NLP). Beyond these, AI holds great promise for transforming healthcare, finance, and transportation, and could play a crucial role in addressing climate change and poverty.</p><br />
                
                <p>2. <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong><br>
                IoT refers to the global network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the Internet. This includes a wide range of sensors used in both industrial and household settings. IoT has successfully automated homes, optimized energy use, and improved transportation, and its influence is expected to grow even more in the future.</p><br />
                
                <p>3. <strong>Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR)</strong><br>
                Interest in AR and VR has surged in recent years. These technologies aim to blend digital information with the physical world, enhancing user interaction. They have applications in entertainment, education, and healthcare, and are expected to become increasingly realistic and immersive.</p><br />
                
                <p>4. <strong>Blockchain</strong><br>
                While blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its potential extends far beyond. As a decentralized ledger, blockchain ensures secure data storage and transfer, benefiting sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p><br />
